# To compile NachOS on a Debian environment (x86), you need to
# install the folowing packages:
#  build-essential
#  g++-multilib (on x86-64 only)
# and a MIPS cross-compiler. See below.


# At the end of the document, you will find a script that can help
# to create a cross-compiler on Debian. However, currently (11/2011),
# Debian is migrating toward multiarch and the script does not work.
#
# What I propose is to install Debian packages of a GCC MIPS cross-compiler
# that has been compiled from and on a Debian squeeze (stable)
# These packages should work on Debian stable (squeeze), testing (wheezy)
# and unstable (sid). They also work on Ubuntu sometimes requiring to
# manually install a extra package.
#
# Only the AMD64 and i386 architecture is supported by these pre-compiled
# packages, not the i386 one.
#
# Just run this script (or look at it and type the commands yourself) to
# install a MIPS cross-compiler

# Here is a script to build and install a cross compiler to be used on Nachos
#
# Contrary to previous document, this script build a recent cross compiler
# (gcc 4.6 by default) so gcc 2.95 is not used anymore.
# improvement: software is installed as real packages on the system
# inconvenient: only works for Debian (unstable and perhaps
#   testing/wheezy) and it could perhaps work with ubuntu (feedback welcome)
#
# Note: recent gcc requires the target libc to build the cross-compiler.
# This is why I cannot tell how to build one only from gcc sources
# (as it was done with gcc 2.95)

# I think I put all required commands. Howver, it is probably better
# to copy and paste the command to be able to look at the results
#
# WARNING: building the cross compiler itself requires lots of time and
# lots of available disk space. It is probably possible to reduce this
# if we build only the C cross compiler (and not C++, ...) but I did not
# look if this can be easily done.

# Do not copy-paste the next line in a interractive shell
# (else your shell will exit as soon as a command does not succeed)
